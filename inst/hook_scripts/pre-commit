# SUMMARY
# ========================================================================
#
# "pre-commit-git-diff-docx.sh:" Small git (https://git-scm.com/)
# hook. It works in combination with another hook,
# "post-commit-git-diff-docx.sh".
#
# Together, they keep a Markdown (.md) copy of .docx files so that git
# diffs of the .md files show the changes in the document (as .docx
# files are binaries, they produce no diffs that can be checked in
# emails or in the repository's commit page).
#
# ========================================================================
# DEPENDENCIES
# ========================================================================
#
# post-commit-git-diff-docx.sh
# pandoc (http://pandoc.org/)
#
# ========================================================================
# INSTALLATION
# ========================================================================
#
#   1) put both scripts in the hooks directory of each of your git
#      projects that use .docx files. There are several options,
#      e.g. you can put them in ~/Software and soft link to them from
#      the hooks directory, e.g.
#
#      cd $PROJECTPATH/.git/hooks
#      ln -s ~/Software/pre-commit-git-diff-docx.sh pre-commit
#      ln -s ~/Software/post-commit-git-diff-docx.sh post-commit
#
#      or you can make a copy in the hooks directory
#
#      cd $PROJECTPATH/.git/hooks
#      cp ~/Software/pre-commit-git-diff-docx.sh pre-commit
#      cp ~/Software/post-commit-git-diff-docx.sh post-commit
#
#   2) make sure that the scripts are executable
#
#      cd ~/Software
#      chmod u+x pre-commit-git-diff-docx.sh post-commit-git-diff-docx.sh
#
#

# DETAILS:
# ========================================================================
#
# This script makes a Markdown format copy (.md) of any .docx files in
# the commit. It then lists the .md file names in a temp file called
# .commit-amend-markdown.
#
# After the commit, the post-commit hook
# "post-commit-git-diff-docx.sh" will check for this file. If it
# exists, it will amend the commit adding the names of the .md files.
#
# The reason why we cannot simply add the .md files here is because
# `git add` adds files to the next commit, not the current one.
#
# This script requires pandoc (http://pandoc.org/) to have been
# installed in the system.
