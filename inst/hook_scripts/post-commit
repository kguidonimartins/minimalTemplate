# SUMMARY
# ========================================================================
#
# "pre-commit-git-diff-docx.sh": Small git (https://git-scm.com/)
# hook. It works in combination with another hook,
# "pre-commit-git-diff-docx.sh".
#
# Together, they keep a Markdown (.md) copy of .docx files so that git
# diffs of the .md files show the changes in the document (as .docx
# files are binaries, they produce no diffs that can be checked in
# emails or in the repository's commit page).
#

# This script checks whether file .commit-amend-markdown exists. If it
# exists, it amends the previous commit adding the names of .md files
# inside it.
